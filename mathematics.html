    <p>I was a PhD student in mathematics at the University of Oxford under the supervision of
        Professor <a href="https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/drutu/">Cornelia Druțu</a>. I successfully defended my thesis
        (<a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:4dc87a3f-66a8-4072-a029-949924a2c476"><i>On the coarse geometry of solvable Baumslag-Solitar groups and relatively hyperbolic groups</i></a>) in May 2024.</p>

    <p>My field of research was "geometric group theory" which involves applying the techniques and intuition of geometry to
        problems in algebra and group theory. I was particularly interested in
    <ul>
        <li>Quasiisometric embeddings between groups and metric spaces</li>
        <li>Algorithmic properties of groups such as automaticity</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>My papers are written under the name <i>Patrick S. Nairne</i>.</p>

    <h2>An integer sequence</h2>

    <p>Imagine that you are about to go for a walk along the number line (a long pebbly beach), beginning at 1 and walking forwards in the positive direction from there.
        Suppose that you begin with a single pebble in your hand.
        As you walk, you obey the following rule: each time you pass a power of 2, multiply the amount of pebbles in your possession by 2; each time you pass a power of 3, divide your pebbles evenly into 3 groups and keep only one of the larger groups (e.g. divide 8 pebbles into 3,3,2 and then keep only 3 pebbles).
        The changing quantity of pebbles in your possession as you walk along the number line forms an integer sequence. The sequence begins <br> <br>

        1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 4, ... <br> <br>

        The plot belows shows the first 1000 elements of the sequence. For more details you can have a look at my paper <i>Embeddings of Trees, Cantor Sets and Solvable Baumslag-Solitar Groups</i> linked above. </p>
